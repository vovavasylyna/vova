# Volodymyr Vasylyna

Hi, you've reached my personal corner of the Internet.

I work as an analyst at <a href="https://sap.com">SAP</a> based in Kyiv, Ukraine. 

I love quiet rest in the mountains and keeping things simple. On my blog, I share thoughts and ideas about personal development, books, work, digital minimalism, and more.

I also run and try to keep my <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/110285148">Strava profile</a> up-to-date.
