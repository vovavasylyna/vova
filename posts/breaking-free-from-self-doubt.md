# Breaking free from self-doubt

2024-11-26

Recently, I’ve found myself thinking that I should read and write more. But I haven’t acted on this thought much. Sure, I read an article here and there, but nowhere near as much as I should. Writing, on the other hand, has been even more rare. I’ve come to realize that if I’m ever going to change this, the first step is to write about why I’ve been avoiding it and what I plan to do about it.

If I had to pinpoint the root cause of my inaction, I’d probably call it laziness. But that alone doesn’t explain everything. Over time, I’ve come to understand that what I’ve been labeling as laziness is actually tied to two deeper issues.

[1] Am I simply not good enough?

Every time I try to write, I can barely get through a few lines before I feel completely stuck. It's easy to blame a lack of talent, and sure, that’s part of it, but the bigger issue is that I don’t believe I can write up to the standards I set for myself. I’ve been caught in a cycle where the fear of not being good at it stops me from writing, and because I don’t write, I don’t get any better.

So, I need start shifting my mindset. The truth is I can’t improve without practicing, so my approach is simple: write consistently, read more, and gradually get better until I’m proud of my progress.

[2] Am I overthinking what others might think?

This fear of not being good enough ties back to another concern: worrying about how my writing will be received by others. If I’m not happy with it, how can I expect anyone else to be? When I read about people accomplishing great things and writing about them so eloquently, it’s hard not to feel discouraged. The pressure to be perfect is overwhelming. I find myself thinking that there’s so much I could do, but I’m not sure where to even start.

But I need to let go of that fear. I can’t let concerns about what others think paralyze me. I’ve got to focus on my own growth and take action, no matter how imperfect that action might seem.
