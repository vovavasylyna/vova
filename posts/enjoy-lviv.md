# How to enjoy Lviv

2025-09-27

First things first: pick a place to rent wisely. I recommend choosing one of the old buildings not far from the old town. The old town itself is something to avoid living in.

As you’re probably hungry after a long trip to Lviv, start with a bowl of ramen at **Ramen Mo**. The food there is delicious, and their dishes are perfect for satisfying hunger.

Take a walk to the **Lviv Art Center**. It’s a wonderful spot to enjoy a coffee in a cozy setting, explore a small exhibition, and take a little break.

From there, stroll about 400 meters to **Ivan Franko Park** for fresh air, autumn charm, and maybe even a cozy walk in the drizzle. Just don’t forget an umbrella.

Hungry again? Time for some pizza at **Promin**. This is the kind of pizza that pairs perfectly with red wine or a fine Ukrainian beer.

Next, visit the **Ya Gallery Penthouse**, located on the 4th floor of a historic building. The building itself is significant, and the gallery continues a tradition of mounting modern art exhibitions in historically resonant interiors. The space retains classical architectural elements: parquet wooden floors, tall ceilings, plaster walls (some intentionally left aged) — all part of the aesthetic.

Start your morning at **Tovarystvo** and order their morning specialties plate with a cup of cappuccino.

Then take a long walk to **KIVSH**, a creative urban space that brings together residents of the creative industries, cultural initiatives, cafés/restaurants, sports & wellness, education, and art. The concept is to revitalize former industrial buildings into a vibrant cluster of creative activity.

While there, don’t miss **Restare**, a showroom of a restoration and architectural salvage atelier. Restare collects and restores items often discarded or overlooked: old doors, gates, fragments of patterned parquet, tiles, bathtubs, decorative elements, and more. It’s the perfect place to find your next favorite thing for your home.

**Lychakiv Cemetery** is another must-see. It is one of the oldest and most famous cemeteries in Europe. Founded in 1786, it has been Lviv’s main cemetery for over 200 years. Today, it’s an open-air museum of funerary art. Around 300,000 people are buried there, including writers, artists, scientists, politicians, and military figures. Many monuments were designed by renowned sculptors and architects, turning the grounds into a sculptural and historical park. Visitors love strolling here because it combines the beauty of an art park, the serenity of a botanical garden, and the depth of a historical archive — all in one walk.

Last but not least, you’ll probably be looking for a good bar - my recommendation is **People Place Bar**. For authentic Ukrainian cuisine, head to **Trapezna Idey**.
