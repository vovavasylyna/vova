# Compass

2024-12-27

It's the end of the year. I don't have many tasks to complete at work as many colleagues are out of office celebrating Christmas. So these days I've been reflecting on some things in my life which I'd like to call as an inner compass, the guiding force that helps me both in my work and everyday life. It feels like something more personal than just a set of principles I've followed. It's a fluid, evolving framework that shapes who I am, influenced by the values and mantras I hold close. This compass isn't fixed. It's a living, breathing part of me that shifts and grows over time.

*Values in life*

- Patience
- Perseverance
- Compassion
- Slow living
- Self-discipline
- Self-care

*Mantras*

- Less, but better
- All limits are self-imposed
- Love the process more than the result
- Practice saying no
