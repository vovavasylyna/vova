# My list of cabins in the Carpathians for solitude and privacy

I was looking for nice houses / cabins for two for a vacation in the Ukrainian Carpathians mountains. The main requirements were relative remoteness from people, pleasant appearance and a good view of the mountains. I'll share the list here down below.
