# Renovation

This was a log of the work we were doing to renovate a 60 sqm apartment located in Kyiv, in one of so-called ‘Stalinka’ buildings. These residential structures date back to the Soviet era and were built during Joseph Stalin's reign, roughly from the late 1930s to the mid-1950s. Our building was built in 1957.
